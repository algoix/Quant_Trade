    "    (2) Series of absolute or squared returns show profound serial correlation.\n",
    "    This contradicts the random walk hyphotesis, as if X, Y are independent,\n",
    "    then |X|, |Y | are independent, and X2 , Y 2 are also\n",
    "    independent, and in consequence they should be non-correlated.\n",
    "    The conclussion is that financial time series are uncorrelated but\n",
    "    not independent.\n",
    "    (3) Conditional expected returns are close to zero.\n",
    "    More problems: this gives that the daily returns form a martingale\n",
    "    difference, i.e. the accumulated process (sum of daily\n",
    "    returns) is a martingale. This supports the martingale hypothesis,\n",
    "    so it is very difficult to predict future values, based on\n",
    "    historical data.\n",
    "    (4) Volatility appears to vary over time.\n",
    "    Defining the volatility as the conditional standard deviation of\n",
    "    the returns given the past information, it is observed that if\n",
    "    recent returns have been large, it is expected to have large returns.\n",
    "    (5) Return series are leptokurtic or heavy-tailed.\n",
    "    A random variable with positive kurtosis is named leptokurtic.\n",
    "    It models a large amount of small movements, plus some relatively\n",
    "    large movements, in other terms, its density is more\n",
    "    narrow around its expectation, and has heavier tails than a\n",
    "    gaussian random variable.\n",
    "    This contradicts the gaussian returns hypothesis in the BlackScholes\n",
    "    model.\n",

    "    Is a tendency for large returns to be followed by large returns\n",

    "the idea of stock prices following a random walk is connected to that of the EMH. The premise is that investors react\n",
    "instantaneously to any informational advantages they have thereby eliminating profit opportunities. Thus, prices always fully reflect the information available and no profit can be made from information based trading (Lo and MacKinley, 1999). This leads to a random walk where the more efficient the market, the more random the sequence of price changes. The EMH and random walks do not amount to the same thing. A random walk of stock prices does not imply\n",
    "that the stock market is efficient with rational investors.\n",
    "A random walk is defined by the fact that price changes are independent of each other (Brealey et al, 2005). For a more technical definition, Cuthbertson and Nitzsche (2004) define a random walk with a drift (δ) as an individual\n",
    "stochastic series Xt  that behaves as:\n",
    "Xt = ∂+ Xt−1 + εt+1 \n",
    "~iid(0,sigma2)\n",
    "The drift is a simple idea. It is merely a weighted average of the probabilities of each price the stock price could possibly move to in the next period. For example, if we had €100 and this moved either 3.0% up or 2.5% down with\n",

    "0.5(0.03) + 0.5(-0.025) = 0.0025 = 0.25%\n",
    "However, even though it is useful, the model is quite restrictive as it assumes that there is no probabilistic independence between consecutive price increments. Due to this, a more flexible model called the ‘martingale’ was\n",
    "devised. This improved on the random walk model as it can “be generated within a reasonably broad class of optimizing models” (LeRoy, 1989:1588). \n",
